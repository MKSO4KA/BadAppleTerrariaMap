The first six bytes are the width and height values ​​from the bytes array, interpreted as 16-bit unsigned integers (ushort).
WidthStart: composed of the first and second bytes (bytes[0] and bytes[1]).
Width: composed of the third and fourth bytes (bytes[2] and bytes[3]).
Height: composed of the fifth and sixth bytes (bytes[4] and bytes[5]).
Each value is formed by concatenating two bytes, where the first byte is the low-order part and the second is the high-order part.
